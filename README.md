# SQL and Python Project
This project demonstrates how **SQL and Python can be used together** to create, manipulate, and analyze databases in a complementary workflow. For that, two situations was simulated:

**Case 1.** Using Python to create and populate a database, then analyzing it in SQL <br /> 
**Case 2.** Using SQL to store data, then analyzing it in Python

# Project Cases
Case 1. Using Python to create and populate a database, then analyzing it in SQL
1. Import the libraries
2. Establish a database connection
3. Create the commands to add information to your database
4. Create a cursor to allows the SQL command to be executed
5. Create the variables
6. Create the SQL command
7. Execute the SQL command
8. End transaction data from Python to SQL
9. Use SQL queries to analyze the inserted data  
   
Case 2. Using SQL to store data, then analyzing it in Python
1. Import libraries
2. Connect the database
3. Read the database
4. Display data from SQL database
5. Analysis on Python using 'groupby', 'count', display, plot, average and others commands

# Results
This project is a simple way to show that both, SQL and Python, can be used to even write and read databases and analyse them, so you can combine these tools to obtain the best analysis for your application. 


# Key Takeaways
- Improved skills in writing and executing SQL queries
- Learned how to establish and manage SQL connections using Python
- Practiced full-cycle data workflows: generation, storage, and analysis
- Reinforced the idea that Python and SQL are not competitors, but allies in data projects
